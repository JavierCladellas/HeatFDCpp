# HeatFDCpp

This is a C++ implementation of the finite differences method to solve the heat equation for a rectangular cooling device.  

The objective of this project is to implement the Finite Difference method in C++ by using the less possible number of libraries. 

More detail on the code and the results can be found in the [report](
    ).
